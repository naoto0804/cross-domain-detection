# Datasets
We provide three datasets (Clipart1k, Watercolor2k, Comic2k).

Please refer to the paper for further details about the datasets.

We do not hold the copyright to the images in the datasets, but to avoid the tedium of downloading and processing the data, we are making available our local copy of the data for non-commercial research purposes only.

## Structure of Dataset
We followed [PASCAL VOC format](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) basically.

We describe an item that indicates origin of an image in each dataset.

- <cmplaces_id>: When the image is collected from [CMplaces](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/cmplaces/).
- <url>: When the image is collected from image search engines.
- <bam_src>: When the image is collected from [BAM](https://bam-dataset.org/)
